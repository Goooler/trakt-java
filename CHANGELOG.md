Change Log
==========

## 5.2.1
_2016-08-18_

* `HistoryEntry` ids can be `Long` (64 bit numbers). Thanks @mattkranzler5!

## 5.2.0
_2016-07-31_

* Add optional start and end date parameters to history methods. Thanks @mattkranzler5!

## 5.1.0
_2016-07-14_

* Added `stats` for movies, shows, seasons and episodes.
* Update retrofit to 2.1.0.

## 5.0.0
_2016-06-09_

* Update to `retrofit2`. Read about the most [notable changes and benefits](https://github.com/square/retrofit/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#version-200-2016-03-11).
  You will have to make changes to your app, see the [README](https://github.com/UweTrottmann/trakt-java/blob/master/README.md#usage)
  for an example of the new code flow.
* Package name changed to `com.uwetrottmann.trakt5`. So you can keep using the old version while updating your code.
* Removed `OAuthUnauthorizedException` and `CheckinInProgressException`. You now have to handle authentication errors
  (check for `response.code() == 401`) and check-in errors (`TraktV2` now has `checkForCheckinError()`) yourself.
* Better integrated support for handling OAuth, removing the need for a dedicated HTTP client (removed `TraktHttpClient`).
* Better support for customizing `TraktV2`. You can now override `retrofit()`, `retrofitBuilder()`, `okHttpClient()` or 
  `setOkHttpClientDefaults()`.
* Add `noseasons` extended flag.
* Removed debug logging. You can easily add your own `HttpLoggingInterceptor` by overriding the new
  `setOkHttpClientDefaults()` in `TraktV2`. See `BaseTestCase` for an example.
* Update joda-time to 2.9.4.

## 4.6.2
_2016-05-27_

* Add `getOkHttpClient()` to `TraktV2` to allow supplying your own OkHttp client instance more easily. 

## 4.6.1
_2016-05-06_

* Fix `dismissMovie` and `dismissShow` endpoints (#77). Thanks @yacsrk!
* Add tests for untested endpoints.

## 4.6.0
_2016-05-06_

 * As a stop-gap solution use OkHttp 3 adapter with retrofit, update to OkHttp 3. Moving to retrofit2 soon.
 * Drop user name from auth code request creator.

   that refresh tokens are supplied together with your access token, you can use them to refresh the access token
   without asking the user for authorization (if the user has not revoked authorization).

3.3.1 *(2014-08-12)*
--------------------

 * Fix `show/summary` not returning user data with default extended flag
   (URL had trailing `/`, causing redirect, stripping auth header).
 * Remove trailing `/` on all other methods using either `Extended` or `Extended2` flag.

3.3.0 *(2014-08-12)*

 * Change fest dependency scope to `test`.

3.0.0 *(2014-02-13)*
------------------------
There were some API breaking changes due to the introduction of a new `Extended` enum.
E.g. instead of calling `libraryShowsAllMinimum(username)` call `libraryShowsAll(username, Extended.MIN)`.
 * `ExtendedParam` replaced with `Extended`, adds a `DEFAULT` value.
 * `user/library/shows` endpoints add `Extended` param, `-Minimum` and `-Extended` versions are dropped.
 * Added `user/library/movies/` endpoints.

 * Use [retrofit][1] 1.4.1.


2.0.1 *(2013-11-03)*
------------------------

 * Only create new `RestAdapter` instance when changing auth, API key or debug flag.
 * Changed tests to use annotations, only setup trakt once per class.

2.0.0 *(2013-10-31)*
------------------------

 * More or less complete rewrite for retrofit backend. Not all previously supported endpoints are available yet (pull request to add new ones, it's easy!), but there are also new ones previously unsupported.
 * `ServiceManager` is now just `Trakt`, endpoints do not require you to call `.fire()` anymore either.
 * For now this is NOT published to a Maven repository, let me know if there is demand.
 * Start testing with FEST.
 * Use [retrofit][1] 1.2.2.


1.3.0 *(2011-12-13)*
-------------------

 * Added list and activity service.
 * Movie and show services now have `checkin` and `cancelchecking` methods.
 * All "getter" methods have been deprecated and instead the instance
   properties should be used directly.
 * Transitioned methods which returned `MediaEntity` to use the more userful
   `ActivityInfo` type.


1.2.1 *(2011-09-15)*
--------------------

 * Add `dismissShow` and `dismissMovie` methods to the recommendations
   service.


1.2.0 *(2011-09-07)*
--------------------

 * Add `print()` method which acts like `fire()` except writes relevant info
   to stdout rather than calling the remote API. This can be very useful for
   debugging just what your application is sending.
 * Add `setUseSsl` toggle to `ServiceManager` and the individual services to
   control whether or not the SSL API endpoint is used.
 * Add `TraktException` which is thrown when an exception was returned from
   the trakt servers.
 * Add genre service for listing movie and television genres.
 * Add filtering methods to the recommendations service for start and end year
   as well as genre.


1.1.0 *(2011-07-17)*
--------------------

 * Fix deserialization of fields whose names contained underscores.
 * `getEpisodes()` in `TvShowSeason` is now a complex type that can hold both
   a count, an episode number list, or a list of episode object.
 * Add new properties to `Movie` and `TvShow`.
 * Some dates are now a `java.util.Calendar` where the precision is to the
   seconds. Ones that remain `java.util.Date` should only be used for the date
   they represent, not the time.
 * The search service is now available from `ServiceManager`.
 * New `enum`s for gender, rating type, and day of the week.
 * __Full test suite implemented__.


1.0.0 *(2011-07-01)*
--------------------

Initial version.
